# TypingGame

    Final Game Project
    This is my implementation of a typing game:
    [game can be played here](https://csdb01.cs.edinboro.edu/~c11019419v/Web_1/TuckerTypeScoreboard/index.html)

    +=+=+=+=+=+=+= Gameplay =+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+

    The buttons at the top are overall self documenting, but if not:

        Random- sets gamestyle to random, generates random words
        Sentence- sets gamestyle to sentence, generates random sentence
        10- sets gamestyle to random, sets wordcount to 10 words
        30- sets gamestyle to random, sets wordcount to 30 words
        50- sets gamestyle to random, sets wordcount to 50 words
        NewGame- generates a new game with previous games settings

    DONT: click any buttons while clock is ticking

    To play:
        
        -click onto the area where the words are to set your cursor
        -begin typing, trying to correctly type all letters
        -backspace will function normally
        -space will bring you to the next word

    Game Finished:

        -Words Per Min and Accuracy will be displayed where the timer was located
        -press any of the buttons to generate a new game
        -your personal high score will be recorded and saved as a cookie (1 year expiration)
